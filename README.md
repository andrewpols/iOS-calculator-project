## Background
- This program utilizes JavaScript along with HTML & CSS to provide a calculator capable of high-level decimal precision.
- The calculator achieves decimal precision through a library called [decimal.js](https://github.com/MikeMcl/decimal.js).
- The program is run non-locally with the help of JSON files built through [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node).
- The original source code can be found in the index.html, main.js, and styles.cs files in the root directory.

## GitHub Pages
- [Try the calculator here!](https://andrewpols.github.io/iOS-calculator-project/)
- NOTE: The .nojekyll file is imperative if run through GitHub pages, as jekyll will ignore the node_modules folder otherwise. If Google or any browser ignores the node_modules folder, simply turn the setting off or else the calculator will not function.
